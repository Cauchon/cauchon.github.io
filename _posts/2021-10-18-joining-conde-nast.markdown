I've accepted a new role as Director of Product at Condé Nast, managing product management for WIRED.

My experience at CNET has been so rewarding over the past six years. Over that time, I've been able to work on several site redesigns and exciting products. Most importantly, the people who work at CNET made the experience noteworthy. I've worked alongside an all-star product and engineering team, best writers in the business, and countless other partners.

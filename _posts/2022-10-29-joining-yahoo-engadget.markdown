I've accepted a new role as Director of Product at Yahoo, managing product management for Engadget.

As a longtime reader of Engadget, I couldn't be more excited to be joining the team. Engadget has served as a breaker of tech news for nearly 20 years. It was also inspiration for Smartphone Nation, which brought me into the world of the publishing world.

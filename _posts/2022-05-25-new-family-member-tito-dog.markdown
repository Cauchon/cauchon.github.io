We are happy to introduce a new member of our family, Tito. He's a good boy who joins us from a rescue and is now a permentant member of our household.

Tito comes from a rescue and his history is somewhat unknown. A DNA test reveals that he is 60% Poodle, 8% Cocker Spaniel and 32% unknown.

You can follow him on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/goodboytitoburrito)
